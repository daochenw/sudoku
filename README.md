# sudoku
This is a C++ translation of Peter Norvig's Sudoku solver implemented in Python at norvig.com/sudoku.html (July 2017). I set myself this project in order to gain a better grasp of C++ structure and syntax. I wrote the programs in the Eclipse Oxygen CDT. In the process, I also gained C++ debugging skills and refamiliarised myself with Python (Norvig's Python code wasn't the  easiest to understand!) I was able to complete this project after studying the Udemy course "Learn C++ by Creating" and the Youtube series "Buckys C++ Programming Tutorials" by thenewboston. Including learning C++, the entire project took 2 weeks of 
after-work and weekend time.
