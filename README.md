# sudoku
This is a C++ translation of Peter Norvig's Sudoku solver implemented in Python at norvig.com/sudoku.html (July 2017). I set myself this project in order to gain a better grasp of C++ structure and syntax. I wrote the programs in the Eclipse Oxygen CDT. In the process, I also gained knowledge of constraint propagation, C++ debugging skills and refamiliarised myself with Python (Norvig's Python code wasn't the easiest to understand!) I was able to complete this project after studying the Udemy course "Learn C++ by Creating" by Andrew Volk and the entire Youtube series "Buckys C++ Programming Tutorials" by thenewboston. Including learning C++, the entire project took 2 weeks of after-work and weekend time. An example solution is included in main.cpp.
